# levelheadimproved
Allows changing of levelhead prefix which on default is Level:
Shows no level instead of random level for false uuids.
## Usage
The best way to use this mod, is using my fork of lunar-client-qt where it is integrated [lunar-client-qt](https://github.com/Youded-byte/lunar-client-qt).
If loaded as an agent without parameters such as in the agents tab, the nicklevel will not be shown and levelhead will not be changed by this agent.
